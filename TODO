This is "correct" behaviour. gdb doesn't initially load the
GNAT (and other) shared libraries. They are loaded on demand.
What you should do is set a breakpoint on "main" and then
run the program. When it breaks on "main", the shared libraries
are loaded and you can proceed as usual.

Cheers

I installed the correct RPM's for GNAT and gnatgdb  on my
computer which runs SuSE Linux 6.1. The problem is that
gdb not is able to set breakpoint on the exception
functions in the gnat runtime, neither with 'break exceprtion'
nor by seting the breakpoint manually with a command like
'break __gnat_raise_constraint_error'. While I links statically,
and not use the shared libraries for runtime there is no
problems.

I think I hve installed the right RPM's.

2. Parallel compiling needed.  Names for up to four computer defined in
   tiacommon, and processor locking implemented, but at present, only
   first is used.

3. More support for other languages.

5. Cursor horizontal position not reset when new files are opened.  Maybe fixed?

7. Shared Library support not implemented.

8. Need undo and repeat typing.  For this, you need to add the appropriate
   methods to the ASourceEditList control.

9. Scrolling left and right in ASourceEditList control.

10. Rewrite the debugger so you can send input to the running program
    while waiting on the output from the debugger.  The debugger waits
    indefinitely if the program is waiting for input.

11. (Texttools) Hilighting is case-sensitive.

12. Warning on opening very large files or binary files.
